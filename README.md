# ssb-git-repo

Host git repos in [secure-scuttlebutt][]

## API

#### `var repo = new GitSSBRepo(sbot, feed, name)`

Get a repo. No side effects. You can only push to the repo if your SSB client
has the private key for the feed ID of the repo.

- `sbot`: a [scuttlebot][] or [ssb-client][] object
- `feed`: ID of the SSB feed that owns the repo
- `name`: string name identifying the repo in the feed
- `repo`: an [abstract-pull-git-repo][]-compliant git repo object
